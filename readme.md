# BigFriendlyRobot #

BigFriendlyRobot is a reddit bot that allows subreddits to automate the user tag feature.  For example, see [/r/bigfriendlyrobot](http://reddit.com/r/bigfriendlyrobot).  To create a tag there, message [BigFriendlyRobot](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BigFriendlyRobot) with the following fields:

	Subject (name of subreddit): bigfriendlyrobot
	Message (in the case of this subreddit, any alphanumeric string with spaces): is your friend
	
The bot would then append "is your friend" to your username the next time it is run.
